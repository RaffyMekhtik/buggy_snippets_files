        """Estimate model parameters with the EM algorithm.

        The method fits the model `n_init` times and set the parameters with
        which the model has the largest likelihood or lower bound. Within each
        trial, the method iterates between E-step and M-step for `max_iter`
        times until the change of likelihood or lower bound is less than
        `tol`, otherwise, a `ConvergenceWarning` is raised.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
            List of n_features-dimensional data points. Each row
            corresponds to a single data point.

        Returns
