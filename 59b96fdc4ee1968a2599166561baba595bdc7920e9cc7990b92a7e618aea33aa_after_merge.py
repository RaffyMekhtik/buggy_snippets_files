    """Generate a distance matrix chunk by chunk with optional reduction

    In cases where not all of a pairwise distance matrix needs to be stored at
    once, this is used to calculate pairwise distances in
    ``working_memory``-sized chunks.  If ``reduce_func`` is given, it is run
    on each chunk and its return values are concatenated into lists, arrays
    or sparse matrices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array [n_samples_a, n_samples_a] if metric == "precomputed", or,
        [n_samples_a, n_features] otherwise
        Array of pairwise distances between samples, or a feature array.

    Y : array [n_samples_b, n_features], optional
        An optional second feature array. Only allowed if
        metric != "precomputed".

    reduce_func : callable, optional
        The function which is applied on each chunk of the distance matrix,
        reducing it to needed values.  ``reduce_func(D_chunk, start)``
        is called repeatedly, where ``D_chunk`` is a contiguous vertical
        slice of the pairwise distance matrix, starting at row ``start``.
        It should return an array, a list, or a sparse matrix of length
        ``D_chunk.shape[0]``, or a tuple of such objects.

        If None, pairwise_distances_chunked returns a generator of vertical
        chunks of the distance matrix.

    metric : string, or callable
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string, it must be one of the options
        allowed by scipy.spatial.distance.pdist for its metric parameter, or
        a metric listed in pairwise.PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS.
        If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix.
        Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is called on each
        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable
        should take two arrays from X as input and return a value indicating
        the distance between them.

    n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of jobs to use for the computation. This works by breaking
        down the pairwise matrix into n_jobs even slices and computing them in
        parallel.

        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
        for more details.

    working_memory : int, optional
        The sought maximum memory for temporary distance matrix chunks.
        When None (default), the value of
        ``sklearn.get_config()['working_memory']`` is used.

    `**kwds` : optional keyword parameters
        Any further parameters are passed directly to the distance function.
        If using a scipy.spatial.distance metric, the parameters are still
        metric dependent. See the scipy docs for usage examples.

    Yields
    ------
    D_chunk : array or sparse matrix
        A contiguous slice of distance matrix, optionally processed by
        ``reduce_func``.

    Examples
    --------
    Without reduce_func:

    >>> X = np.random.RandomState(0).rand(5, 3)
    >>> D_chunk = next(pairwise_distances_chunked(X))
    >>> D_chunk  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    array([[0.  ..., 0.29..., 0.41..., 0.19..., 0.57...],
           [0.29..., 0.  ..., 0.57..., 0.41..., 0.76...],
           [0.41..., 0.57..., 0.  ..., 0.44..., 0.90...],
           [0.19..., 0.41..., 0.44..., 0.  ..., 0.51...],
           [0.57..., 0.76..., 0.90..., 0.51..., 0.  ...]])

    Retrieve all neighbors and average distance within radius r:

    >>> r = .2
    >>> def reduce_func(D_chunk, start):
    ...     neigh = [np.flatnonzero(d < r) for d in D_chunk]
    ...     avg_dist = (D_chunk * (D_chunk < r)).mean(axis=1)
    ...     return neigh, avg_dist
    >>> gen = pairwise_distances_chunked(X, reduce_func=reduce_func)
    >>> neigh, avg_dist = next(gen)
    >>> neigh
    [array([0, 3]), array([1]), array([2]), array([0, 3]), array([4])]
    >>> avg_dist  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    array([0.039..., 0.        , 0.        , 0.039..., 0.        ])

    Where r is defined per sample, we need to make use of ``start``:

    >>> r = [.2, .4, .4, .3, .1]
    >>> def reduce_func(D_chunk, start):
    ...     neigh = [np.flatnonzero(d < r[i])
    ...              for i, d in enumerate(D_chunk, start)]
    ...     return neigh
    >>> neigh = next(pairwise_distances_chunked(X, reduce_func=reduce_func))
    >>> neigh
    [array([0, 3]), array([0, 1]), array([2]), array([0, 3]), array([4])]

    Force row-by-row generation by reducing ``working_memory``:

    >>> gen = pairwise_distances_chunked(X, reduce_func=reduce_func,
    ...                                  working_memory=0)
    >>> next(gen)
    [array([0, 3])]
    >>> next(gen)
    [array([0, 1])]
