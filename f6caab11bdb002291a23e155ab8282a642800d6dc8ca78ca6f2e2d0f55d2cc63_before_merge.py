        The model need to have probability information computed at training
        time: fit with attribute `probability` set to True.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like, shape = [n_samples, n_features]

        Returns
        -------
        T : array-like, shape = [n_samples, n_classes]
            Returns the log-probabilities of the sample for each class in
            the model. The columns correspond to the classes in sorted
            order, as they appear in the attribute `classes_`.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability model is created using cross validation, so
        the results can be slightly different than those obtained by
        predict. Also, it will produce meaningless results on very small
        datasets.
